## üìù Roadmap

## April 2025 Goals:
- **Finish transitioning to medium-level problems**.
- **Focus on algorithms**:
   - Dynamic Programming
   - Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS)
   - Greedy Algorithms
   - Divide & Conquer
   - Backtracking
- **Start exploring databases**:
   - SQL basics
   - Database design and normalization

## May 2025:
- **System Design**:
   - Learn about distributed systems, caching, load balancing.
   - Start building system design solutions.

## Key Areas to Focus On:
1. **C++ fundamentals (STL lib, etc.) and advanced topics**.
2. **LeetCode Contest preparation** (for fun and skill-building).

I aim to gradually increase problem difficulty and diversify topics as I improve.
